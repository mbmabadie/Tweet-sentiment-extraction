# Tweet-sentiment-extraction
### Disc: Extract support phrases for sentiment labels using Deep learning.

Every second, thousands of tweets from various users with different thoughts are seen on Twitter. Therefore, it is challenging to detect the sentiment underlying these tweets and their effects on specific individuals, businesses, and brands. In order to determine if a tweet has a positive or negative effect on the users, it would be interesting to investigate the sentiment of the tweets. Thus, we would extract keywords and phrases from tweets to determine the sentiment. On the Tweet Sentiment Extraction1 Kaggle-provided dataset, analysis and extraction are performed. The dataset that we considered contains a wide set of tweets that are classified into 3 different types of sentiments, namely, positive, negative, and neutral.
In this project, we discuss the sentiment analysis of tweets using different deep-learning models and compare their performance.
